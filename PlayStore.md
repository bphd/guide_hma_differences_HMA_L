# Hiding from Store

Besides hiding root from sensitive (secure) apps, you can also hide installed apps from an app store.<br>
<i>This is convenient if you have an app installed that is:<br>
- Installed from a different app store.
- Modified.
- Older version.<br></i>

This is an example of hiding app(s) from Google Play Store.<br>

## Create a Blacklist Template.

Open HMA from your app drawer.<br>

Tap on <b>Template Manage</b>
