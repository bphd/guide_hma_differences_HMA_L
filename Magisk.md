# Magisk Configuration

Minimal set of instructions to configure Magisk to pass Play Integrity and hide root from apps.

## Overview
This is a brief guide using the official Magisk build(s) to:<br>

1) Pass Play Integrity.
2) Hide Root From Apps.

This is done by using two modules.<br>
SaftyNet-Fix to pass Play Integrity and Shamiko to hide root from applications that you choose.<br>

Note:<br>
>This is not to discourage use of or disparage those who use other variants (forks) of Magisk or alternative integrity verdict or root hiding solutions.<br>
>Alpha and Delta, have been appreciated and served their purpose, particularly in the gap period where MagiskHide (the original root hiding method) was removed, and an alternate was found.<br>
>As there are often rapid changes in Alpha/Delta forks, a decision was made for simplicty's sake, to concentrate on using the official Magisk build(s) in this brief guide.<br>

This guide will not cover the installation of Magisk as that can vary greatly with device or OS.<br>
Installation steps are best handled in the existing XDA threads for Magisk, or on occasion in your devices specific XDA threads on how to root x device.<br>
