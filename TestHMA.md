# Testing HMA

Of course you're probably going want to test the apps you primarily installed HMA to assist with, but you can of course test with the following test apps (some of which you may have had installed already and added during the <b>Configure Apps</b> step.

<b>Applist Detector</b>, is linked in the main screen of HMA itself, but not installed by default, so on tapping it for the first time, it will prompt you to download it, or you can grab it before hand.<br>

Other well known detection tools:

<b>Please Note:</b>
- After adding apps to the root blacklist or other configuration changes, you need to not only reboot to allow the changes to take effect, but also to force close and clear data for any of the above testing apps before testing again.

- The results of the tests are beyond the scope of this guide.<br>
  <i>This is merely a guide for HMA.</i><br>
  Discussion of your test result(s) would be better off in the Magisk thread(s) or your device thread(s) on xda.
