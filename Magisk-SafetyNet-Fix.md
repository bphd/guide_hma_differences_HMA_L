# Magisk & Universal SafetyNet Fix Installation

$\textcolor{orange}{\textsf{Magisk:}}$ 

There are two main variants of Magisk, Offical and Delta, their page links on XDA are below. This guide wont cover the installation of Magisk as it can vary by device, and those installation steps are best handled in the existing XDA threads for Magisk, or on occasion in your devices specific XDA threads on how to root x device. 

We do not necessarily advocate a preference of Magisk variant, however, if in doubt, it does make sense to at least initially try Magisk Official, if simply because the userbase is larger if you have an issue that needs investigation. Delta *can* provide more effective app hiding methods for problematic (root detection aggressive) apps due to its inclusion of functions since removed from official Magisk, and through additional functions added by its developer HuskyDG. It is possible to switch between Magisk variants, but that is again best handled in the relevant Magisk threads linked.

**Please Note:** Please do NOT post Magisk issues here, they will be closed without reply.
