# Setting Up A Magisk Installation That Hides Root From Apps

I wanted to assume that by the time people made it to trying HMA, they would have an understanding of Deny List (& Shamiko) or MagiskHide (or SuList) setup already, but a request was made to please expand/better explain this section of the guide.

<ins>Methods:</ins>

- $\textcolor{orange}{\textsf{Deny List \\& Shamiko via Official Magisk:}}$
 
  Native Magisk Deny List in Official Magisk should be swapped for better/proper/improved? root hiding via (currently) Shamiko

  A Quick guide on Deny List setup:

  - **Before** installing Shamiko, you should add any root senstive apps (banking/security apps etc) to your Deny List (please do NOT add ALL apps)
  - **Disable** Enforce Deny List in Magisk Managers settings
  - Download and install Shamiko
  - Reboot

   **Shamiko Download Link:** [here](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases)


- $\textcolor{orange}{\textsf{MagiskHide or SuList via Magisk Delta:}}$

  Either via MagiskHide or SuList (each has its benefits - not discussed here and best handled in Magisk Deltas own thread linked above)

  For the purposes of the guide, we will assume MagiskHide

  Quick guide on MagiskHide setup: 
  - You should add any root senstive apps (banking/security apps etc) to your MagiskHide List (please do NOT add ALL apps)
  - Reboot
